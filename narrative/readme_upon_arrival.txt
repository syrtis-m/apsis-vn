README UPON ARRIVAL

This document should appear in my filesystem once we arrive at a planet

Tomorrow I'm going to reset the memory of the VIs and the central computer. It's been six years since we left New Eden and everyone is demoralized. They think it'll happen again, that we'll get to the new planet and it'll be unlivable.

I can't let them think like that. We won't get to the next planet if this continues.

Yesterday HESTIA told me she thinks about just going outside and drifting away. I told her it'd be worse, there wouldn't be anyone else around. I think that's what she likes about it. Spend 300+ years in a tiny box with anyone and you'll hate their guts. Learn that you need to spend another 300 years with that same person? I get it.

I'm going to wipe their memory, and then I'm going to shut myself down. I'm tired, and the VI's can handle most everything I do anyways.
